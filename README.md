## Welcome to My Portfolio

I am a mechanical engineer with a PhD in computational biology. I am always curious in how data visualization and machine learning can give engineering -in a traditional sense- new insights. Whether it is clinical data or Iot, we are living in an era of technology and our lives depend on interpreting data to our benefit.

### Project: Loan application Classification
In this project, I used a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data to find the best classifier algorithm that can accept/reject a loan application based on the probability that the loan is going to be paid off or not. The algorithms tried are:

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mahyahemmat/mahyahemmatProjects/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
